Development
===========

This section provides guidance for developers contributing to `glmpynet`. It outlines the strategic roadmap, the tactical phase-by-phase development plans, and the reference guides for building and testing the code.

Our development philosophy is **phased and incremental**. We begin with a high-level strategy, create a detailed action plan for the current phase, and then execute that plan with focused, bite-sized tasks.
