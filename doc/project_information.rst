Project Information
===================

This final section provides supplementary information about the ``glmpynet`` project, including its software dependencies, guidance on how to cite the library in your own work, and details on contributing.

Dependencies
------------

The ``glmpynet`` library relies on a small set of well-maintained, open-source Python packages, which will be installed automatically when you install ``glmpynet`` via ``pip``.

``numpy``
   For efficient numerical operations and array handling.

``scikit-learn``
   For compatibility with the broader machine learning ecosystem and for utility functions.

``glmnet``
   The core dependency, which provides the compiled Fortran backend for high-performance model fitting.

How to Cite glmpynet
--------------------

If you use ``glmpynet`` in your research and would like to cite it, please use the following BibTeX entry. Citing software helps the developers and maintainers justify their work and secure funding for future development.
