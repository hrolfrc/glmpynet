Welcome to bib-ami's documentation!
===================================

**bib-ami** is a command-line tool for improving the integrity of BibTeX bibliographies. It helps researchers by automating several common data cleaning tasks: merging multiple ``.bib`` files, identifying and removing duplicate entries, and validating or finding missing DOIs by querying the CrossRef API.

The goal is to produce a clean, consolidated, and more reliable BibTeX file, reducing the manual effort required to manage academic references.
