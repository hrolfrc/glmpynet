Welcome to glmpynet's documentation!
=====================================

**glmpynet** is a Python package providing a scikit-learn-compatible LogisticRegression API powered by the high-performance glmnetpp C++ library, focusing on logistic regression for binary classification. Built with Bazel and Conda for reproducibility, glmpynet ensures reliability through rigorous glmnetpp validation.

This documentation guides you through installing the package, using it in data science workflows, and understanding its design. Future versions may support multi-class classification and additional glmnetpp features.

Project Status
==============

glmpynet is in early development, focusing on validating the glmnetpp environment and implementing a minimal LogisticRegression with default settings. See the ROADMAP for details.
