The Problem & Solution
======================

This section explains the motivation behind the ``bib-ami`` tool. It
details the common challenges faced when managing academic references
and outlines the principled approach the tool takes to solve them.

The Challenge of Messy Bibliographies
-------------------------------------

Managing bibliographic references is a foundational task for researchers
and academics. However, BibTeX files, especially those aggregated from
multiple sources or generated by automated tools, frequently suffer from
data quality issues that require significant manual intervention. These
problems include:

-  **Duplicate Entries:** The same publication may appear multiple times
   with minor variations in title, author formatting, or citation key,
   leading to a redundant and unprofessional bibliography.

-  **Missing or Invalid DOIs:** A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is the
   standard for ensuring a reference is persistent and verifiable.
   Entries often lack a DOI or contain one that is incorrect or
   outdated, hindering readers’ ability to locate the source material.

-  **Inconsistent Metadata:** Key fields like journal names, publication
   years, or author lists may be incomplete, inconsistently formatted,
   or contain errors. This requires manual correction to ensure
   citations are accurate and adhere to publication standards.

-  **High Manual Effort:** The cumulative effect of these issues is that
   researchers must spend a considerable amount of time cleaning their
   bibliographies, detracting from their primary work of research and
   writing.

These problems create a classic data science challenge known as entity resolution: identifying and merging multiple records that refer to the same real-world entity—in this case, a single academic publication.

The ``bib-ami`` Philosophy: Creating a "Golden" Bibliography
------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of ``bib-ami`` is to implement a robust, automated
workflow that transforms a collection of untrusted BibTeX files into a
single, clean, and verified "golden" bibliography. This process is
guided by a clear definition of the desired outcome and a set of
non-negotiable principles.

The Desired Outcome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final, curated bibliography produced by the tool must meet the
following five criteria:

Trustworthy
   The final set of references is reliable, with its core metadata
   validated against authoritative sources.

Complete
   The process does not discard any legitimate references, even if they
   could not be automatically verified. Instead, they are flagged for
   review.

Auditable
   The final status of every single input record is traceable, with a
   clear reason why it was included, merged, or flagged as suspect.

Enriched
   Each trusted reference is populated with a complete set of verifiable
   metadata fields available from the authoritative source.

High-Fidelity
   User-generated content from the source files (e.g., notes,
   annotations, file links) is correctly preserved and merged into the
   final, clean records.

Guiding Principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To achieve this outcome, the workflow is built on four core principles
that inform every step of the process.

#. **Authoritative Data Reigns Supreme:** Data from an external,
   authoritative source like CrossRef is treated as the **ground
   truth**. Data from a local source file is treated as an **unverified
   claim**. The workflow must always prioritize authoritative data when
   defining a record’s core identity and descriptive fields.

#. **Every Input Must Be Accounted For:** No source record can ever be
   silently dropped or lost. The final output must be traceable back to
   every single initial input, ensuring a complete audit trail.

#. **Preserve User Intent:** The system must distinguish between
   descriptive metadata that can be authoritatively corrected (e.g., a
   misspelled title) and intentional user-generated content (e.g.,
   ``note``, ``file``). The latter represents work done by the user and
   must be preserved and correctly reconciled.

#. **Triage, Don’t Discard:** The system’s job is not to make a final
   judgment on ambiguous records. Its primary role is to cleanly
   separate high-quality, verified records from questionable ones,
   empowering a human to make the final call on the exceptions.
