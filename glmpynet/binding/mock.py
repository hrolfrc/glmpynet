    A mock implementation of the GlmNetBinding interface for testing.

    binding to be compiled.

        Simulates a call to the glmnet solver using scikit-learn.

        It fits a standard scikit-learn LogisticRegression model and then
        formats the output to match the expected dictionary structure from
        the real glmnet engine.

        Args:
            x (np.ndarray): The training data matrix.
            y (np.ndarray): The target vector.
            alpha (float): The elastic net mixing parameter. Used to select
                           L1 vs. L2 penalty.
